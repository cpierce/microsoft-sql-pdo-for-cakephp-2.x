# SybaseDB 1.0 #

Creates a PDO connection to MSSql server through Sybase dblib as a plugin for CakePHP 2.x

### Background ###

To many people on the Internet were looking for a simple way to connect to a MSSQL db from a linux installed cakePHP app.  I was one
of them so after hours of research the birth of this plugin was planned.  A few hours later it was completed.

### Prerequisites? ###

* php5-sybase package installed on your linux system (apt-get install php5-sybase)
* enable php Sybase module in php.ini file (extension=pdo_dblib.so)
* CakePHP 2.x app installed and baked on your server

### How to use the plugin ###

Update your `composer.json` file using the following:

```
composer require cpierce/cakephp-sybasedb
```

Enable the Plugin in your `app/Config/bootstrap.php` file:

    <?php
    CakePlugin::load('SybaseDB');


If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();`, then this step is not necessary.

Configure a database connection in `app/Config/database.php` file:

    <?php
    class DATABASE_CONFIG {

	    public $default = array(
		    'datasource' => 'SybaseDB.Sybase',
            'host' => 'someplace\SQLEXPRESS',
            'login' => 'somelogin',
            'password' => 'Ur_P4ssw0rd#',
            'database' => 'some_database',
        );

    }


You could also use another connection instead of `$default` and then specifying `$useDbConfig` in your model.

From here you can now access the data the normal cakePHP way:

    <?php
        $this->Model->find('first');



### Credit where it is due ###

Some of the code used was taken from the CakePHP 1.x SQLServer DBO for Microsoft Windows and altered to fit the PDO DBlib.  Special thanks to the people who have used this and helped me test it (Especially Jeffery Bell and Marcel Wedel)

#### Change Log ####
Version 1.0
- Updated for better and easier use of composer.

Version 0.3b
* Fixed a problem with long table cell names (over 30 characters).

Version 0.2b
